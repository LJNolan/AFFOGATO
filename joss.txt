# Summary

Nearly all galaxies contain supermassive black holes at their centers, and some
of these black holes accrete mass rapidly and emit powerful jets, the brightest
sources in the universe.  These systems are called Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).
Their extremely bright light overlaps with and obscures the light of their host
galaxy, making studies of such galaxies more difficult without a mechanism to
subtract the AGN light.  This is one of many cases in which one employs image
decomposition to model and separate the components of an astronomical image.  A
few well-established programs have become the best tools for this task, but
remain difficult to automate without external 'wrapper' programs.

# Statement of need

gAlactic Faint Feature extractiOn with GALFIT-bAsed Tools in pythOn (`AFFOGATO`)
is a Python package which acts as a wrapper for the popular image decomposition
tool `GALFIT` *CONSIDER CHANGING TO GALFITM* [@Peng:2002; @Peng:2010] with a
particular eye towards studies of AGN.  `GALFIT` is intentionally structured to
be automated using external scripts, as effective usage requires modelling begin
with well-motivated initial guesses of model parameters (e.g., Sersic index and
magnitude for a Service profile), and these can vary widely across different use
cases. However, some general functions are possible to write in Python, which has
become the dominant language for most tasks in astronomy, especially for
early-career scientists.

`AFFOGATO` uses parameter estimation from the `photutils` package [@photutils] to
facilitate automatic "blind" usage of `GALFIT` without manual determination of
initial guesses, and producing informative and aesthetically-pleasing figures. 
While manual fine-tuning remains necessary in general for high-confidence scientific
results (and is possible using the same wrapper functions), this automation greatly
speeds decomposition of medium to large samples of images. In addition to this
general-use functionality, we include a specific example implementation for the
study of AGN host galaxies with HST, which at its highest level only requires the
user to specify the coordinates of an AGN and the desired filter and the utility
automatically downloads the best archived HST data, an appropriate PSF model,
performs the decomposition, and produces an appropriate figure.  This will enable
extremely rapid analysis in studies interested in the underlying features of AGN host
galaxies.  More generally, `AFFOGATO` acts as a well-documented entry point to
development of one's own `GALFIT` wrapper in Python.

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
